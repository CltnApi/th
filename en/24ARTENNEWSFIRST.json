performance, with revenue growth of 37.8% and a net profit increase of 145% compared to the same period last year. This was driven by increased demand in pet food business, which remains the primary growth driver. For the first nine months of this year, net profit surged by 283.4% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong demand from major brand clients who launched new products tailored to owners seeking specialised pet food. The gross profit margin remains within the target of 20-21%. The company is confident that total revenue for this year will meet the target of THB 6,500 million, comprising THB 5,700 million from pet food business and THB 800 million from human shelf-stable food. Production capacity expansion plans are progressing as expected. In August, the company commenced dry pet food production under the “Pro” brand and expanded capacity for canned and pouch-packed products, which will increase wet pet food production to 59,000 tons per year by Q1 next year.","status":"FINISH_META","category_code":"PUBLIC_RELATIONS","language_code":"en","tags":null},{"code":"ART2411201012G68IVT","origin_url":"https://www.nationthailand.com/vdo/more/40043454","site_code":"TH05","url":null,"image":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebb7d928-d4c4-4e3c-afdf-ae3f0f769999","title":"Voices of Change: CP Group's Young Leaders on the Global Stage 🌍✨","description":"Get ready to meet four of CP Group’s delegates who proudly represented Thailand at the One Young World Summit 2024 in Montreal!","status":"FINISH_META","category_code":"LIFESTYLE","language_code":"en","tags":null},{"code":"ART24112010122JGQ5U","origin_url":"https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2905601/putin-open-to-ukraine-truce-talks-with-trump","site_code":"TH01","url":null,"image":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daec8601-219c-4325-916a-d935899a0af1","title":"Putin ‘open to Ukraine truce talks with Trump’","description":"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin is open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Donald Trump but rules out making any major territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO, five sources with knowledge of Kremlin thinking told Reuters.","status":"FINISH_META","category_code":"WORLD","language_code":"en","tags":null}],"prev":null,"next":"/th/en/24ARTENNEWSLLOOCR.json"}
